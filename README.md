# Fraud-Detection-System-by-Facial-Recognition
Hi! My name is Ngoc Duyen, currently a 3rd year student at the University of Greenwich. I am doing a facial recognition test for students taking an exam. The system will authenticate the student's face in real time during the exam. I hope my talent will make the students study harder. Thank you for your helping!
